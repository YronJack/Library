## Features
### Main Classes:

 - Author: Represents authors with relevant details.
- Hub: Central class that orchestrates the main operations of the library.
- Book: Represents books with title, author, and category information.
- Student: Represents students with unique identifiers.
- Issue: Manages the issuance of books to students.
- BookStore: Manages the collection of books.
- IssueStore: Manages the collection of issued books.
- StudentStore: Manages the collection of students.
### Interactive Menu:

- Developed using console-based navigation to handle user interactions.
- Options include: Add/Search/List books, Manage book issues, etc.
- Robust exception handling for user inputs.
- Search functionality to find books by title, author, or category.
- Listing functionality to display all books, issued books, and students.
- Issue management to allow students to borrow and return books.

### Data Persistence:

- Current implementation uses CSV files for data storage and retrieval.
- Data is stored in separate files for books, students, and issues.
- Each file is structured to allow easy reading and writing of data.
- Example file structure:
  - `books.csv`: Contains book details (title, author, category).
  - `students.csv`: Contains student details (name, ID).
  - `issues.csv`: Contains issue records (book ID, student ID, issue date, return date).
- Data is loaded into memory at application startup and saved back to files on exit.
- Future improvement: Implement a more robust data storage solution as a SQL database using JDBC/JPA.

### Unit Testing:

- Comprehensive tests using JUnit for critical methods.
- Covers positive, negative scenarios, and edge cases.

### Error Handling:

Handles invalid inputs gracefully with user-friendly feedback messages.
- Additional Functionalities:

Import/Export library data.
Scalable design to introduce more features.
